-   📲 Uses native frameworks to package Android and iOS apps — smaller and faster than Tauri2.
-   🤗 Easy to use — just one GitHub Token is all you need to get a desktop app.
-   🌹 No need to install complex dependencies locally — use GitHub Actions for cloud-based automatic packaging.
-   🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Internationalization support — automatically follows your system language.
-   💡 Supports custom JavaScript injection — write your own JS to inject into the page.
-   🎨 Beautiful and user-friendly UI — better experience for beginners, supports Chinese names for packaging.

## FAQ

1.

However, the cost of the official signature is $99 per year... Therefore, it is necessary to manually bypass the signature to use it normally）

```sh
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PacBao.app
```

1. When you package the app, Mac users may see an “App is damaged” warning on installation. click cancel and Run the following command, then reopen the app:
