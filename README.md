## FAQ

1. Mac users may see an “App is damaged” warning on installation. click cancel and Run the following command, then reopen the app:（This is because the application requires an official signature to avoid the prompt of "The application is damaged" popping up after installation. However, the cost of the official signature is $99 per year... Therefore, it is necessary to manually bypass the signature to use it normally.
   ）

```sh
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PakePlus.app
```

2. When you package the app, Mac users may see an “App is damaged” warning on installation. click cancel and Run the following command, then reopen the app:

```sh
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/YourAppName.app
```

3. If you encounter any issues while using the program, please download the latest version, as versions developed before 2025 were based on Tauri v1.0. In 2025, Tauri was upgraded to v2.0. If the latest version still has issues, please submit an issue with detailed information so that we can update and resolve it more quickly.

4. After you add the GitHub Token, PakePlus will fork a PakePlus repository into your own repository. All your future projects will rely on this repository for creation and compilation, so please do not delete your PakePlus repository.

## Developing PakePlus

If you want to develop PakePlus locally, ensure your environment is prepared beforehand. Make sure Rust `>=1.63` and Node `>=16` (e.g., `16.18.1`) are installed on your computer. For installation guidance, please refer to the [Tauri Documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

If you’re unfamiliar with these, it’s best to try the one-click packaging tool above.

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Local development [Right-click to open debug mode.]
pnpm run dev

# Package the app
pnpm run build

# github action
